'zero-rust': patch
---

The Rust client shares a row between its replica, its diffs, and its IVM sources instead of copying it: a `json::Object`'s copies now share its entries until one of them is changed. 100,000 rows and a view of them take 181 MB instead of 467 MB (JS takes 245 MB), a first sync of zbugs' 2,058 rows takes 19 ms instead of 26 ms, and a poke of 1,000 rows takes 8.8 ms instead of 15 ms.
