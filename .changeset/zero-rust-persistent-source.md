'zero-rust': patch

Make optimistic updates and round trips cost the same with any view size: a memory source's indexes are now persistent B+ trees, as in Swift, so the fork each mutation takes shares the rows and a write copies only the nodes on its path. Before, the first write to a fork copied the whole index: with a 100,000-row view, an optimistic update took 852 µs and is now 19 µs.
